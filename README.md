# Python Assignment

This assignment is a commandline-based program that calculates the grades of the user inputs; first the user is prompted to enter their course marks and then the code then finds the average of the data and outputs the letter grade.

## This assignment demonstrates my skills in:

▪ Creating variable following Python naming convention
▪ Reading/output data from/to VS Code Terminal
▪ Converting string data type to integer
▪ Using the two types of loop: While and For
▪ Arithmetic operations with BEDMAS Rules
▪ Using lists (Like Arrays in JavaScript)
▪ If elif condition with logical operator

## Technologies

![Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

## Getting Started

The project has the following file structure.

▪ py-assignment.py
▪ README.md

## Testing

While coding, I tested my frequently to solve any bugs before continuing with my code.

## Acknowledgements

This assignment is a part of the Full Stack Software Development program at the Canadian Business College(CBC). I am grateful for the support I received from my instructor at CBC,[Anmar Jarjees](https://github.com/anmarjarjees), in learning the python material to complete this assignment.
